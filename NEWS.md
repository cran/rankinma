### Writing style of *rankinma*

This package is written according to Google's R style. For readers, details of naming rules are listed as follows:
> 1. **.R file** is named using lower case with underscore "_" between words (*e.g. get_metrics.R*). 
> 2. **function** is named using verb or verb with noun, and the first character of each word is written in capital letter (e.g. `GetMetrics()`).
> 3. **object** is named using noun with the first word in lower case, but the first character of rest words is written using capital letter (e.g. `argOutcome`).
> 4. **variable** is named using noun written in lower case. Words of variable name are separated by "." if a variable name consists of more than two words (e.g. `data$metrics.name`).

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
